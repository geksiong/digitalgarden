# My Digital Garden

This is a space for cultivating my thoughts and ideas, using the concepts of **Digital Gardens**, the **Zettelkasten method**, and **Learning in Public**.

My interests are mainly in technology, software engineering and music.

## Digital Garden?

> A digital garden is an online space at the intersection of a notebook and a blog, where digital gardeners share seeds of thoughts to be cultivated in public. Contrary to a blog, where articles and essays have a publication date and start decaying as soon as they are published, a digital garden is evergreen: digital gardeners keep on editing and refining their notes.

## Zettelkasten method

> A Zettelkasten is a personal tool for thinking and writing. It has hypertextual features to make a web of thought possible. The difference to other systems is that you create a web of thoughts instead of notes of arbitrary size and form, and emphasize connection, not a collection.
