# Welcome to My Digital Garden

This is a space for cultivating my thoughts and ideas, using the concepts of **Digital Gardens**, the **Zettelkasten method**, and **Learning in Public**.

My interests are mainly in technology, software engineering and music.

## What are Digital Gardens?

> A digital garden is an online space at the intersection of a notebook and a blog, where digital gardeners share seeds of thoughts to be cultivated in public. Contrary to a blog, where articles and essays have a publication date and start decaying as soon as they are published, a digital garden is evergreen: digital gardeners keep on editing and refining their notes.

> The Garden is an old metaphor associated with hypertext. Those familiar with the history will recognize this...
> The Garden is the web as topology. The web as space. Itâ€™s the integrative web, the iterative web, the web as an arrangement and rearrangement of things to one another.

## Blog + Wiki = Bliki?

In 2003, Martin Fowler wrote:

Like a wiki it will build up a body of cross-linked pieces that I hope will still be interesting in a year's time.

## Zettelkasten method

> A Zettelkasten is a personal tool for thinking and writing. It has hypertextual features to make a web of thought possible. The difference to other systems is that you create a web of thoughts instead of notes of arbitrary size and form, and emphasize connection, not a collection.
