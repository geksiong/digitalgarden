## Switch to CircuitPython?

The official firmware for the Pico is MicroPython, and I had been trying out tutorials with it. Then I discovered others are using CircuitPython. CircuitPython is built by Adafruit, on top of MicroPython. I thought it would be good to have a try, since MicroPython is quite low-level for some the things I wanted to do with the Pico. CircuitPython is also supposed to be more portable across different boards.

So far my observations are:
- going by the examples that people posted, the APIs can be quite verbose
- I'm confused by how package management is supposed to work. Simply trying to install Adafruit's OLED SSD1306 package resulted in me running out of storage.
